🛡️ AI for Retention: Finding the Best Model to Predict Customer Churn
Retention is a data problem. In my latest Data Science project, I built an end-to-end system to predict customer churn, moving from raw data exploration to a live, cloud-ready dashboard.

The "Model Tournament": To ensure the highest accuracy, I didn't just settle for one algorithm. I conducted a comparative analysis of five different classifiers to see which could best capture complex customer behaviors: ✅ Logistic Regression (Baseline) ✅ K-Neighbors Classifier ✅ Support Vector Machines (SVM) ✅ Decision Trees ✅ Random Forest

The Results: After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest/SVM models led the pack, achieving a predictive accuracy of 84.5%. This allows the business to identify at-risk customers with high confidence.

Key Project Features:

📊 Deep EDA: Uncovered that tenure and contract types are the strongest predictors of loyalty.

💻 Interactive Dashboard: Built a Streamlit app where users can adjust customer profiles and get instant risk assessments.

💡 Business Logic: The system provides specific "Next Actions"—like loyalty offers—to help turn a potential "Churn" into a "Stay."

☁️ Deployment: Scaled for the web and ready for Microsoft Azure.

The Tech Stack: Python | Scikit-Learn | Pandas | Streamlit | Azure | Joblib

This project taught me that the best Machine Learning models aren't just about high accuracy—they're about providing the right insights to make better business decisions.
